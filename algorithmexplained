This algorithm uses a tree structure too keep the allocation information. In this case, an array based tree is implemented. The begining of the chunk memory is being used for keeping the dynamically created tree. In this dynamic allocation stands for creating the tree based on given chunk size. As buddy algorithm requires trees of size 2^n, we take the given chunk size as the lower limit and rounded up the exponential component of 2^n where it stands for the size of the represented virtual memory. The size of the tree is calculated with respect the worst case situation. The worst case situation is defined as there will be lots of 256 byte allocations where the chunk memory is fully allocated. After the calculation the memory for keeping the tree data is also allocated by balloc algorithm
